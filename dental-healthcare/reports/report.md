# Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) and Demographic Context in New Jersey  
## A Comparative County-Level Analysis Using Immigration and Race Proxies

---

## Abstract

Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are a central federal tool for identifying gaps in oral health care access. While prior research has examined associations between HPSA residence and socioeconomic vulnerability, less attention has been given to how *designation patterns and structures* differ across counties with varying demographic contexts. This analysis evaluates Dental HPSA designation intensity, severity, and designation-type composition across New Jersey counties, comparing counties with higher immigrant and minority population shares to those with lower shares using county-level American Community Survey (ACS) proxies. Results show that Dental HPSA designation intensity does not increase linearly with immigrant or minority presence. Instead, high-immigrant and minority counties exhibit more heterogeneous designation structures and localized high-severity shortages, consistent with the administrative nature of HPSA designation and prior findings on urban access complexity.

## 1. Background

Dental access disparities remain a persistent public health concern in the United States. Dental HPSAs, designated by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), are commonly used to identify areas and populations with insufficient provider availability. These designations influence workforce incentive programs, funding decisions, and policy planning.

However, HPSA designations are generated through administrative criteria—such as provider-to-population ratios, poverty measures, and service area definitions—rather than direct observation of unmet need. Prior research has noted that these criteria may capture geographic shortages more readily than socially mediated access barriers, particularly in urban areas with large immigrant and minority populations.

This study examines whether Dental HPSA designation patterns differ across counties with varying demographic contexts, with a focus on immigration- and race-related population characteristics.

## 2. Data and Methods

### 2.1 Data Sources

- **Dental HPSA records** were obtained from HRSA’s detailed designation dataset and filtered to New Jersey counties.
- **Demographic context variables** were derived from ACS 5-year county-level estimates, including:
  - Percentage foreign-born
  - Percentage Hispanic/Latino
  - Percentage Black
  - Percentage of households with limited English proficiency
  - Total population and selected socioeconomic indicators

### 2.2 Demographic Context Index (DCI)

To enable structured comparison, counties were grouped using a Demographic Context Index (DCI), constructed as the mean of standardized values for the four demographic proxies listed above. Counties were categorized into Low, Mid, and High DCI terciles. The DCI is used solely as a comparative grouping tool and does not represent a measure of vulnerability or need.

### 2.3 HPSA Metrics

The analysis examines multiple complementary HPSA metrics:
- **Designation intensity:** Dental HPSA records per 100,000 residents
- **Severity structure:** Maximum HPSA score and proportion of high-severity records (score ≥ 19)
- **Designation type mix:** Geographic, population-group, and facility-based designations

This multi-metric approach avoids reliance on a single summary measure and reflects best practices for interpreting HPSA data.

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Designation Intensity and Demographic Context

Dental HPSA designation intensity does not increase monotonically with immigrant or minority population share. Counties in the High DCI group exhibit moderate and relatively tightly bounded per-capita designation rates. In contrast, several Low and Mid DCI counties display substantially higher intensity values and greater variance.

Scatter analysis of HPSA intensity against percentage foreign-born further demonstrates the absence of a linear relationship. Counties with the highest immigrant shares cluster around low-to-moderate intensity levels, while some counties with lower immigrant representation exhibit the highest per-capita designation rates statewide.

---

### 3.2 Severity Patterns

High-severity Dental HPSA scores are present in both high- and low-DCI counties. In High DCI counties, high-severity designations tend to be localized rather than widespread, resulting in lower average severity despite the presence of severe access gaps in specific populations or settings.

This pattern suggests that average severity metrics may understate cumulative access burdens in demographically complex counties where shortages are fragmented across multiple designations.

---

### 3.3 Differences in Designation Type Mix

Clear differences emerge in the composition of HPSA designation types across DCI groups. High DCI counties exhibit a more heterogeneous mix of geographic, population-group, and facility-based designations. Low DCI counties rely more heavily on population-group designations and show less diversity in designation structure. Mid DCI counties display a pronounced presence of facility-based (particularly FQHC-related) designations.

These findings indicate that HRSA’s identification of dental shortages varies not only in intensity but also in form, reflecting differences in how access barriers manifest across demographic contexts.

## 4. Interpretation and Relation to Prior Research

The findings align with prior research documenting imperfect alignment between HPSA designations and broader measures of social vulnerability. They also reinforce the importance of distinguishing among HPSA designation types when evaluating access patterns.

Rather than indicating an absence of dental access challenges in immigrant- and minority-dense counties, the results suggest that such challenges are more likely to be expressed through fragmented, population-specific, or facility-based designations rather than county-wide geographic shortages. This interpretation is consistent with public health literature emphasizing that access barriers in urban immigrant communities are often mediated by language, insurance, and system navigation factors.

## 5. Limitations

This analysis is subject to several limitations:
- County-level aggregation may mask within-county heterogeneity.
- HPSA designation populations are not deduplicated across overlapping designations.
- ACS proxies do not capture undocumented status or informal care utilization.
- The analysis is descriptive and does not establish causality.

These limitations underscore the importance of cautious interpretation.

## 6. Conclusion

Dental HPSA designation patterns in New Jersey vary meaningfully by demographic context, primarily in designation structure and severity localization rather than raw intensity. Counties with higher immigrant and minority population shares exhibit more complex and segmented designation portfolios, reflecting the multifaceted nature of access barriers in urban environments. Comparative approaches that integrate demographic context and designation structure provide a more nuanced lens for evaluating equity in oral health access than single-metric or choropleth-based analyses.
