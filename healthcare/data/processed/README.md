# Processed Data

This directory contains **derived datasets** generated from the raw HRSA Dental HPSA files
and American Community Survey (ACS) county-level estimates.

All files in this folder are **analysis-ready** and are suitable for sharing, visualization,
and replication of results presented in this project.

Raw source files are not included in this repository.  
See `data/raw/README.md` for instructions on obtaining original datasets.

## Files

### `nj_county_hpsa_acs_comparative.csv`

County-level analytical dataset used for all figures and summaries in this project.

Each row represents a **New Jersey county** and combines:
- Aggregated Dental HPSA designation metrics
- Demographic context proxies derived from ACS 5-year estimates
- Comparative grouping variables used in analysis

---

## Key Variables

### County Identifiers
- `county_geoid` – 5-digit county FIPS code
- `county_name` – County name (New Jersey)

---

### Dental HPSA Metrics (HRSA)

- `hpsa_record_count` – Number of Dental HPSA records associated with the county  
- `hpsa_records_per_100k` – Dental HPSA records per 100,000 residents  
- `hpsa_score_mean` – Mean HPSA score across records (interpret with caution)  
- `hpsa_score_max` – Maximum HPSA score observed in the county  
- `pct_high_severity_records` – Proportion of records with HPSA score ≥ 19  
- `designation_population_sum` – Sum of HPSA designation populations across records  
  *(Note: populations are not deduplicated across overlapping designations)*

---

### Designation Type Shares

Proportion of Dental HPSA records by designation type (based on record counts):

- `share_type__Geographic`  
- `share_type__Population`  
- `share_type__Facility`  
- Additional facility subtypes (FQHC, correctional) where applicable

Shares sum to 1.0 across designation types for each county.

---

### Demographic & Socioeconomic Proxies (ACS)

County-level demographic context variables derived from ACS 5-year estimates:

- `pop_total` – Total population  
- `median_household_income`  
- `poverty_rate`  
- `pct_foreign_born`  
- `pct_hispanic`  
- `pct_black`  
- `pct_asian`  
- `pct_limited_english_hh` – Households with limited English proficiency  

These variables are used as **proxies** for demographic context and are not direct measures
of access or vulnerability.

---

### Demographic Context Index (DCI)

- `dci` – Mean of standardized demographic proxy variables  
- `dci_group` – Tercile-based grouping (`Low DCI`, `Mid DCI`, `High DCI`)

The DCI is used exclusively to support **comparative analysis** across counties and does not
represent a composite vulnerability score.

---

## Notes on Interpretation

- HPSA designations are **administrative constructs**, not direct measures of unmet need.
- Per-capita and severity metrics should be interpreted in conjunction with designation type mix.
- County-level aggregation may mask within-county heterogeneity, particularly in large urban counties.
- This dataset supports **descriptive and comparative analysis**; it is not intended for causal inference.

## Reproducibility

This dataset is generated by running the project notebooks located in `notebooks/`.
All transformations and calculations are documented in the code.
