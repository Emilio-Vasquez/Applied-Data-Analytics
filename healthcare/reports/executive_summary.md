# Executive Summary  
## NJ Dental HPSA Equity Analysis

### Purpose
This project examines how Dental Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation patterns differ between New Jersey counties with higher immigrant and minority populations and those with lower shares, using county-level demographic proxies and a comparative analytical framework.

### Key Findings

- **No linear relationship between immigrant presence and HPSA intensity**  
  Counties with higher immigrant and minority populations do not consistently receive more Dental HPSA designations per capita than less diverse counties.

- **Greater variability in lower-diversity counties**  
  Several counties with lower immigrant representation exhibit the highest per-capita designation rates, while high-immigrant counties cluster within a moderate intensity range.

- **Localized severity in high-immigrant counties**  
  High-severity Dental HPSAs are present in immigrant- and minority-dense counties but tend to be concentrated in specific populations or facilities rather than appearing as county-wide shortages.

- **Distinct designation structures by demographic context**  
  High-immigrant counties display more heterogeneous mixes of geographic, population-group, and facility-based designations, while lower-immigrant counties rely more heavily on population-group HPSAs.

### Interpretation

These findings suggest that Dental HPSA data reflect not only the presence of access challenges but also how those challenges are administratively recognized. In urban, demographically complex counties, access barriers may be expressed through fragmented or population-specific designations rather than concentrated geographic shortages.

### Implications

- Single-metric or choropleth-based interpretations may obscure important differences in how shortages manifest.
- Evaluating designation structure alongside demographic context provides a more accurate and policy-relevant understanding of oral health access equity.
- Comparative frameworks can support more informed planning and resource allocation without over-claiming causality.

### Scope and Limitations

This analysis is descriptive and based on aggregated public data. It does not measure individual-level access or utilization and should be interpreted as an examination of designation patterns rather than direct need.
